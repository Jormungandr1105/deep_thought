# SETUP

This folder is comprised of bash scripts that handle the MPICH installation on each node. Begin single node construction by running:

	./build_mpi.sh

**OR**

Place all of the current node hostnames in the hosts.txt file, and run:

	./setup_all_nodes.sh

Installation should proceed without error.
